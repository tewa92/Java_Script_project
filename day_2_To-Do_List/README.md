# TO-DO List App

This is a simple TO-DO list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks to a list, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.
- **Remove Task**: Users can click on the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
- **Data Persistence**: The application stores task data locally using the browser's localStorage API, ensuring that tasks are preserved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

2. Enter a task in the input box and press the "Add" button.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Click on the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
5. Tasks are automatically saved and restored from local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
